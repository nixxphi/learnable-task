##Version control acts like a time machine for your files. it lets you control track changes, saves them, and lets you:
° Go back to any previous version.
° See who made what changes.
° Collaborate with others on the same file without conflicts.
° Protect your work from accidental loss. ️

###Git vs. GitHub: 
In the software development landscape, version control is critical for maintaining project integrity and facilitating collaboration. While often used interchangeably, Git and GitHub represent distinct entities:

° Git is a distributed version control system (DVCS). It functions as a toolset for tracking changes in files, creating snapshots (commits) at key points, and enabling developers to revert to previous versions or work independently on separate branches. Git operates locally, allowing offline work and flexibility.

° GitHub is a cloud-based Git repository hosting service. Think of it as a platform where developers store their Git repositories (projects) and collaborate. GitHub offers features like social coding, issue tracking, pull requests for merging code changes, and a vibrant community for code sharing and learning.

####Here are 3 popular alternatives to GitHub:
° Gitlab
° BitBucket
° Gitea
